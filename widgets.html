              My name is Dhaval Patel and I am a Computing Science student at the University of Alberta. When I first
              started my university career, I was majoring in Biology. After taking an Intro to Computation class, I became
              intrigued by the world of computer science. So much that I switched majors.
            </p>

            <p class="text">
              Switching into computer science without ever having written a single line of code, it was a huge learning curve.
              I remember doing basic assignments and labs which would take most people up to 30 mins to complete, however I 
              was spending more than 3x that amount of time trying to figure it out. It felt like everyone had much more 
              experience and knew what they were doing.
            </p>

            <p class="text">
              To combat this, I started looking at online resources I could use to gain more skills. There is so much information
              available online that it can be overwhelming on knowing what is the best and what will be the most helpful and
              efficient. Through a lot of trial and error, I found online resources to help me throughout my coding journey.
              I have included a whole range of resources here for everyone, irrespestive of their experience. From beginners to
              experts, this list will surely have something for everyone to learn from.
            </p>

            <p class="text">
              In addition to learning resources, I have also included lots of resources that helped me as a computer science major.
              In switching from biology to computer science, it was a very different experience and I felt there were a lot of things
              that no one told me beforehand that I had to learn along the way. This can be treated as a guide as it has information on
              online courses, internships, resume advice, and more!
            </p>

            <p class="text">
              I hope that this platform can help out anyone who wants to learn computer science or expand their existing skillset.
              I am by no means an expert about any of these topics, I just want to share what I've learned and hopefully help and 
              inspire other people.
            </p>
